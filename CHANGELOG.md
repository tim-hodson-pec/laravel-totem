## Unreleased

### Fixed

- A task whose cron expression never matches a calendar date (for example `0 0 31 2 *`) no longer breaks the task list, the task view, the JSON export, or `schedule:list`. The parser throws `RuntimeException('Impossible CRON expression')` after a bounded search; `Task::$upcoming` is now `null` for such a task and every surface renders it as `Never`. The scheduler itself was never affected, since it matches the current minute rather than searching forward. `Totem::nextRunDate()` is the shared helper. (PR #419)

## v12.0.2 - 04/21/2026

### Fixed

- Empty output popup on the task-view page. The `<task-output>` Vue component received an empty `:output` prop because `@json()` produced a JSON literal whose outer `"` delimiters collided with the HTML attribute's own `"` wrappers, making the rendered HTML malformed. Replaced with `Js::from()`, Laravel's purpose-built helper for embedding JS expressions inside HTML attributes. (PR #419)
